	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by? </h2> 

	<body>

	<p>Two websites that inspire me are <a href="http://www.bondfire.co/">Bondfire Inc.</a> and <a href="http://thelocalpalate.com/">The Local Palate.</a> 

	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

		<p>Bondfire Inc. is composed of a rectangle of text on either half of the page that balance one another. The text on the left is written in white over a photograph of bright green palms in a greater rectangle of negative space. The right half of the screen effectively uses white space to draw the eye to the bold, black text letting the reader know that the site is a studio focused on internet based work. The text on the right half of the screen is larger, using size to emphasize importance.</p>

		<p>The Local Palate uses size to emphasize hierarchy, making the word "Palate" most important. The two large images on either side of the page balance one another and are emphasized to let the viewer know that the site is about food, specifically in the south. The majority of the page is filled with bright images and text that heighten the sense of taste. The word "palate" in combination with photographs of food emphasize the point of the site and also draw the viewer in.</p>

	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

		<p>The two sites are similar in that they both use minimal text on the main page. Both sites use black, bold font of a fairly large size. Both sites also use black, white and grey for the majority of the page and contrast these with one bright color to create interest and emphasis. Bondfire Inc. uses about half the page to display a bright graphic whereas The Local Palate uses the entire page to display graphics. Bondfire Inc. relies heavily on the negative space to draw viewer attention to the minimal text. In contrast, The Local Palate overstimulates the viewer with many images and big, bold text.</p> 

	<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>1</strong></li>
				<p>Focal point: Bold title at bottom of page and entire-page image coming into focus at the top of the page, "further down the trail". Hierarchy: Title and clear image correspond as the main point of the site. Balance: Clear image and title balance one another because they draw equal attention and are on opposite ends of the page.</p>
			<li><strong>1a</strong></li>
				<p>Focal point: Footprints on the trail representing forward movement. Hierarchy: First, the footprints show the progress being made, the most important aspect of the second page. Next, the text explains how to acheive this progress. Balance: The text and image offset one another in the white space.</p>
			<li><strong>2</strong></li>
				<p>Focal point: Tree in the center of page. Hierarchy: Tree represents the focus of the site and the text below it puts the image into words. Balance: The tree is centered on the page with white space/negative space behind it.</p>
			<li><strong>2a</strong></li> 
				<p>Focal point: Bold text opposite the up-close photograph of the same tree. Hierarchy: The text is the most important component of the second page. The tree carries the theme to the second page. Balance: The tree and text offset one another.</p>
			<li><strong>2b</strong></li>
				<p>Focal point: Bold text. Hierarchy: The text is the most important but the image also carries the theme. Balance: The image and text are created within two equal imaginary rectangles.</p>
			</ul>
