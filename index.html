		About Molly
	</h1>
	<p>
		I'm a recent college graduate, living in Cortland, Ohio. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because my broad Communications background requires further development and skills in order to prepare me for the working world. I am hoping to gain some hard, technical skills to accompany my oh-so-soft communcation studies skills. 
</p>
<h2>
	My Mission
</h2>
<p>
	As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a Communications Specialist in Marketing because I like to work in a community-driven, upbeat, and tech-forward work environment where I can maximize my skills and collaborate with others on a daily basis. 
</p>

	Other
</h2>
	<p> I love to travel and learn from other cultures. I spent last summer backpacking through Thailand with a few college friends and spent time working on a self-sustainable farm. I hope to share what I have learned with others and plan on using the knowledge I gain in this class to do just that.
