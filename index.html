<body>
	<p>
		I'm a recent college graduate, living in Cortland, Ohio. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because my broad Communications background requires further development and skills in order to prepare me for the working world.  
</p>
<h1>

</h1>
<p>
	As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a Communications Specialist in Marketing because I like to work in a community-driven, fun, and tech forward work environment.
